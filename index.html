      <h1>Ghana Bauxite Company Limited</h1>
      <p>First discovered in 1914 in Ghana by Sir Albert Kitson, bauxite is an ore and the 
        main source of aluminium. Though the British Aluminium Company gave approval for the mining
         of Bauxite in 1928 at Awaso in the country’s western region, the exploration and mining works 
         started only in the 1940s. Ghana has substantial 
        deposits of bauxite in regions of Ejuanema, Nyinahin, and Kibi, though most
         of them remain unexploited with mining activities mainly undertaken in Awaso
        Ghana was allowed as a member of the International Bauxite Association in
         November 1974. Ghana Bauxite Company has been working on the mining site in Awaso since
          1941, which is said to have enough reserves to last for more than three decades. Other bauxite
         reserves of Ghana are said to have reserves to last for more than a century.
        In 2009, Bosai Group successfully acquired from the world mining giant, Rio 
        Tinto, the Ghana Bauxite Company Limited. It was later found through 
        exploration that the company owned the world’s best deposits of high 
        alumina and low silica bauxite ore, the amount of which reached approximately
         100 million tonnes in total.</p>
         <div class="bg-info">
          <i>The mine is an open pit with low stripping ratio which poses little
             difficulty for mining operation. The typical proportion of Al2O3
              content in crude bauxite
             ore is approximately 49%, which can reach above 50
